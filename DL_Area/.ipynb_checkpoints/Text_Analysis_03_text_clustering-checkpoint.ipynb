arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .\\n43

adequate with thick, fluffy towels .\\n44

                                                                                                                                                                                                 The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .\\n46

the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47                                                                                                                                       my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51

the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .\\n54

remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .\\n55

had several problems .\\n56

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .\\n58

bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the bathroom .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

                                       The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .\\n62

did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .\\n63

one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .\\n65                                                                                                                                                                                                        It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67

                      The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69

the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71
